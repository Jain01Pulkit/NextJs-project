Rendering means converting your code into HTML
PreRendering means generate HTML in advance on the server side and consist of Server side rendering(SSR) and static generation
-> In Static Generation HTML is generated at build time and is REUSED FOR EACH REQUEST. 
-> With Static Rendering, both Server and client components can be prerenderd on the server at the build time
-> SSR is the pre-rednering method that generates the HTML is generated on EACH REQUEST.

NextJs is react framework for single page webApps ,nextJs internally use Reactjs
Problem in react is that it needs too many external libraries for its basic functionality like routing,Internal Css support,middleware,optimising build etc.
In nextjs it all comes preInstalled plus it has the ability of server side rendering and can be useful in SEO optimisation.

Server Component: 
- These Component render on the server side, 
- By default all Components are server Component in nextJs
- These Component are closer to backend so backend related code should be written in these Component
Client Component:
- These Component render on the Client side.
- can make Client Component by using 'use client' directive
- All UI realted code and events should be written in these Component
NOTE: -These two Component can be used together . Make a practice to make Component that involves data from the backend as server Component
     and all UI interactive actions,button clicks,search bar,browser APIs functionality Component as client Component

NextJs uses file system based routing
- Normal Routing : if you want to make a route of /dashboard => src or app/dashboard/page.js
- Nested Routing : if you want to make a route of /dashboard/overview => src or app/dashboard/overview/page.js
- Dynamic Routing : if you want to make a route of /dashboard/overview/nameOfPerson => src or app/dashboard/overview/[name]
You can get Dynamic route name by fetching params as prop value in the dynamic Component
The folder name will match with the route name , page js should be present in every folder

Two ways of routing are : Linking and Navigation
Difference between Linking and navigating to a page is that Link don't affect the website at all whereas navigation affects the website

NOTE: -When passing information to a component you have to receive it as params keyword only
Layout files are used to provide a common Component to all Component like header,sidebar
middleware is also part of nextJs routing

Catch-all segments: This is used for getting all the routes inside another route. 
- Suppose /study is the route. Then make another folder named [...lecture] this will run every time user enters /study/anything and no page not found error will come
- data in the segments component will come in an array if the route is /study/anything/something/ ... so on.  

No internal style is availaible in nextjs only global and inline css is there
